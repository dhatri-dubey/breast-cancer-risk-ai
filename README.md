CNN-based metastasis risk prediction using real and synthetic data (TCGA-BRCA)
# Breast Cancer Metastasis Risk Prediction using AI

This repository contains my MSc dissertation project from BITS Pilani, focused on predicting metastasis risk in breast cancer patients using deep learning and synthetic data.

🧠 **Project Overview**  
This project explores the application of Generative AI in healthcare to overcome data scarcity in oncology. It combines real histopathology images from the TCGA-BRCA dataset with synthetically generated clinical features to improve classification performance.

📊 **Tech Stack**
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV
- Google Colab
- ImageDataGenerator
- Random Forest Regressor

🔍 **What I Built**
- A CNN model to classify patients as high or low metastasis risk
- Synthetic data generation pipeline using Random Forest Regressor
- Augmentation and preprocessing of pathology images
- Model evaluation using AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score

📂 **Folder Structure**
/images → Histopathology image samples
/models → CNN model architecture & weights
/notebooks → Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
/data → Processed and synthetic data samples (anonymized or simulated)
📎 **Key Insights**
- Synthetic data improved model generalization with limited real data
- Demonstrates potential of Generative AI in cancer diagnostics
- Ethical handling of healthcare data maintained throughout
